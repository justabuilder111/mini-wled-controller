## 10/27/2025 - 1: Research  

today and yesterday I did some research on what components to use and how it should look
looked through existing esp32 based wled controllers
I decided that I want this to be usb-c powered so you can power it with a generic charger and a powerbank if you want to make something portable using it
not 100% sure about the looks yet, I'll do the schematic first!

(I didn't have any other image to add)
  

## 10/29/2025 - 2: Work and more research  

working on the schematic
it takes me some time to read thru the datasheets, find the right components then wire them up properly
havent designed a pcb in a long time lol
i think the hardest parts are finished though

## 11/1/2025 4 PM - 3: Finished schematic  

I finished the schematic, took me a long time to go thru all datasheets and connect everything right
I'm pretty sure everything is alright, I'll check it a few more times later
now starting the pcb design

## 11/1/2025 6 PM - 4: Fixes and costs  

I converted the project to EasyEDA Pro and everything broke... spent the time fixing everything and I also made sure all my parts are basic where possible and have economic assembly available
